## Why NorthRelay?

### The "Noisy Neighbor" Problem

When you use traditional email services, you share IP addresses with thousands of other senders. If one of them sends spam, **your emails suffer too**.

### The NorthRelay Solution

Our **Two-Pool System** gives you control:

* **Shared Pool** - For development and low-volume senders (free & $5/mo)
* **Isolated Pool** - Dedicated reputation for production apps ($29+/mo)

# The Two-Pool System



# The Two-Pool System

> Understanding Shared vs Isolated IP pools

***

## What Are IP Pools?

When you send email through NorthRelay, your messages exit through one of two **IP pools**:

| Pool         | Tiers          | Exit IP           | Use Case                      |
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Shared**   | Sandbox, Micro | VPS 1 (Public IP) | Development, low-volume       |
| **Isolated** | Startup, Scale | VPS 2 (WireGuard) | Production, business-critical |

***

## Shared Pool

The Shared Pool is perfect for:

* Development and testing
* Low-volume transactional emails
* Startups validating product-market fit

**Trade-off:** You share IP reputation with other senders. If someone else on the pool sends spam, it could affect your deliverability.

***

## Isolated Pool

The Isolated Pool provides **sovereign IP reputation**:

* Your emails exit through a dedicated gateway
* No "noisy neighbor" risk
* Premium deliverability for business-critical emails

```
Your Email → NorthRelay → WireGuard Tunnel → Isolated Gateway → Gmail/Outlook
```

***

## Which Pool Is Right for You?

| Scenario                   | Recommended Pool   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Just testing               | Shared (Sandbox)   |
| Side project               | Shared (Micro)     |
| SaaS with paying customers | Isolated (Startup) |
| Enterprise/High volume     | Isolated (Scale)   |

***

## Upgrading Between Pools

Upgrading is instant:

1. Go to **Dashboard → Billing**
2. Select your new tier
3. Complete payment
4. Your next email automatically routes through the Isolated Pool

No code changes required - routing is handled automatically based on your account tier.

## Using SMTP

```javascript
// Node.js with Nodemailer
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.north-pipe.ca',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: 'your-email@example.com',
    pass: 'nr_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx',
  },
});

await transporter.sendMail({
  from: 'you@yourdomain.com',
  to: 'customer@example.com',
  subject: 'Hello from NorthRelay!',
  text: 'Your first email sent successfully.',
});
```

# Installation & Quick Start



# Installation & Quick Start

> Get up and running with NorthRelay in 5 minutes

***

## Prerequisites

* A NorthRelay account ([Sign up here](https://northrelay.ca/signup))
* An application that sends email (WordPress, Node.js, Python, etc.)

***

## Step 1: Create an Account

1. Go to [northrelay.ca/signup](https://northrelay.ca/signup)
2. Enter your email and create a password
3. Verify your email address

***

## Step 2: Get Your SMTP Credentials

After logging in, navigate to **Dashboard → API Keys** and create a new API key:

```
SMTP Host: smtp.north-pipe.ca
SMTP Port: 587 (TLS)
Username: your-email@example.com
Password: nr_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx (your API key)
```

***

## Step 3: Configure Your Application

Use the SMTP settings above in your application. See our integration guides for:

* [Node.js (Nodemailer)](../guides/nodejs-integration)
* [Python (smtplib)](../guides/python-integration)
* [WordPress](../guides/wordpress-integration)

***

## Step 4: Send a Test Email

```bash
# Using swaks (SMTP testing tool)
swaks --to test@example.com \
      --from you@yourdomain.com \
      --server smtp.north-pipe.ca:587 \
      --auth LOGIN \
      --auth-user your-email@example.com \
      --auth-password nr_live_xxxxxxxxxxxx \
      --tls
```

# Introduction to NorthRelay

> What is NorthRelay and why should you use it?

***

## Overview

NorthRelay is a **sovereign SMTP infrastructure** designed for developers who need reliable email delivery without the risks of shared IP reputation.

***

## The "Noisy Neighbor" Problem

When you use traditional email services, you share IP addresses with thousands of other senders. If one of them sends spam or gets blacklisted, **your emails suffer too**.

This is the "noisy neighbor" problem - your legitimate business emails end up in spam folders because of someone else's bad behavior.

***

## How NorthRelay Solves It

NorthRelay uses a **Two-Pool System**:

1. **Shared Pool** - For development and low-volume senders (Sandbox & Micro tiers)
2. **Isolated Pool** - Dedicated IP reputation for paid users (Startup & Scale tiers)

When you upgrade to an Isolated Pool, your emails exit through a **completely separate IP address**. Your reputation is yours alone.

***

## Key Features

* 🚀 **Quick Setup** - Send emails in under 5 minutes
* 🛡️ **Sovereign IPs** - No noisy neighbors on paid tiers
* 🔧 **Self-Service Tools** - Pre-Flight Check, Blocklist Monitor, Connectivity Doctor
* 📊 **Real-Time Analytics** - See delivery status, bounces, and reputation scores
* 🔐 **Enterprise Security** - TLS encryption, DKIM signing, DMARC compliance

## Connection Issues

### "Connection refused" on port 587

1. Check your firewall allows outbound port 587
2. Verify the hostname: `smtp.north-pipe.ca`
3. Test with: `telnet smtp.north-pipe.ca 587`
